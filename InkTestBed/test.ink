<p> Alia: I miss them so much, this is getting absolutely insane with
the loneliness, eating alone, and literally talking to no one but
myself all day. I miss the sound of my mother's voice in the morning
and the smell of fresh black coffee.
Angel: What do you mean? Do you wanna come back home as in back home
four hours away?
Alia: Yes, I think I do, this place is not what I expected it to be.
Angel: I think you should, it is time and you have been wanting to for
a while know. </p>
